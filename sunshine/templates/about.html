  <h3 id='what-is-this'>What is this?</h3>

  <p><strong>Illinois Sunshine</strong> is a tool for browsing political contributions in the state of Illinois.</p>

  <p>The data comes from the <a href='http://www.elections.il.gov/'>Illinois State Board of Elections</a>, which has been collecting this data electronically since 1994. We built Illinois Sunshine to give journalists, activists and citizens better access to this data.</p>

  <h3 id='who-has-to-report-campaign-finance'>Who has to report campaign finance?</h3>
  <p>Any political committee that exceeds $5,000 in either receipts or expenditures over the period of a year (this is the filing threshold). Once a committee exceeds the filing threshold, they are covered by the <a href='http://www.elections.il.gov/Downloads/CampaignDisclosure/PDF/CampDiscAct.pdf'>Illinois Campaign Disclosure Act</a> (PDF) and are required to report contributions and expenditures accordingly.</p>

However, prior to July 1999, when electronic filing was introduced, much of the data is incorrect or missing. Keep this in mind when working with the data.</p>
